Post Content: Currently going through a quarter life crisis. Thankfully I am very privileged and grateful that I have a support system but it is eating at me that I constantly rely on their shoulders. 

Starting September, I started having physical affects of PTSD and started getting regular panic attacks and eventually finally got medicated on Zoloft. I thought it would help, and it has with the anxiety, but I now feel lifeless, lack hope, and don’t know if I can persevere this time. 

I feel horrible for committing … likely one of the stupidest shit I have done in my life in grad school and it is eating away at me … and I have been avoiding classes and my emails for weeks. For context, I was working on an assignment with someone else for a final project and didn’t do my share of work for the draft. Initially, I meant to respond to her right away, but then I took a stress nap, and that hour has now evolved into 2+ weeks where I have not even checked into any of my classes both online, in person, haven’t registered for classes for the next semester, or anything. 

All I crave is sleep and I feel worthless and horrible. I’m in massive credit card debt and will have to ask my parents for rental support for December - and if I am kicked out of my grad program for pure stupidity and ghosting, I am on another further level of screwed. 

This would be the entryway towards my dream career and I constantly daydream of a way to turn back time and not be a bad person to work with on an assignment because then I know it wouldn’t trigger this level of incompetence. 

I failed and I do not know how to recover. Anxiety is preventing me from checking my school emails and my school Canvas. I have no money and if I am kicked out, i don’t know how i will survive on my own. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s eating away at me and life is feeling worthless as I feel like a statistical failure - someone who was doomed from the beginning.

i’m not sure what i am seeking but i just need hope that i have something for me out there - i know i am selfish and a bad person for not doing my share of work, and i know i will likely get kicked out of my grad program for ghosting . i just want hope that there is a way to soften the blow? i understand i have to face my consequences and i just don’t know if i can anymore. 

i am grateful for the level of privilege i have and my loved ones which makes me feel even more horrible - it’s a fact that i am being lazy and an asshole and i am taking resources from those who are very much more deserving. I just don’t know how I can make my life worth it at this point? 

So many wonderful people have lost their lives by this age or are homeless or in horrifying situations and yet I am here instead of them, moping around, not taking full advantage of what I have and I don’t know what to do. 

EDIT: 

folks (or bot?)… per the private messages.. i am not asking for help on essays or my assignments, i can do it myself T-T  

i am merely a flawed human who has fucked up and asking for advice to recover on said fuck up.. perhaps deal with the anxiety … 

User Comment: Hey man…it’s time to reach out to your campus mental health resource and your professors. Let them know this is going on. They might be more lenient than you’d think (this happened to me). I ended up taking a year off school and working, then returning to finish. But it sounds like your body is screaming for help. 

You’re not alone in this. Seek therapy or a change in meds, let your professors know, seek support from family & friends. Don’t do it alone. Act now and be transparent. The support might just be enough to carry you through the end of this semester & help you plan for the next upcoming one. 

Feel free to dm. We had very similar experiences.
Author Reply: Thank you! I will send a dm shortly - I greatly appreciate your assistance!

Post Title: Dealing with brain fog?
Post Content: Does anyone else struggle with extreme brain fog when depressed? Or even a little after depressive episodes? Recently, it's been so hard to even think clearly or even properly communicate. Especially with writing.  I used to be so good at writing, but now even the most basic shit takes so much effort and is sub-par. It just takes so much energy and effort.  Just writing this post has taken me thirty minutes. 

Its so fucking tiring because I feel stupid and its causing problems with school and relationships. 

If this is a common thing, how do you guys deal with it? 

User Comment: I’d say get evaluated. It was ADHD for with a splash of executive dysfunction for me.
Author Reply: I actually suspect that I have ADHD. I can' t get evaluated though bc my family is too poor.

Post Title: Swallowing anxiety is getting me down.
Post Content: So every evening when I get around to eating my dinner, I have horrible anxiety when I swallow my food. Like my brain is convincing me that I can’t swallow or if I do swallow, then I’m going to choke. More often than not I have to swallow my food with water or I just give up entirely. The thing is though, I can drink water very easily without thinking I’m going to choke on it so I’m not sure where this anxiety is coming from when it comes to food. 

Another weird thing to add is that it only ever happens in the evening, it never happens when I eat breakfast or when I have lunch, I can always swallow perfectly fine in the mornings and afternoons, so why is it only the evening when I’m getting this anxiety? 

Does anybody else experience this? If so, what do you do to get past it? It’s really starting to get me down now as I can’t even enjoy my evening meals anymore.

Post Title: How often do you hear a combined word instead of individual words?
Post Content: Let's say someone said 

"We got a new brand in"

And your brain heard..

"We got a new Brandon" 

Does anyone else here do that or am I going crazy?

User Comment: After I hear something like that, I spent a few seconds spiraling thinking maybe we do live in a society where people say things like "we got a new Brandon", what happened to the old Brandon? Did I know him? Is this just a dude with the same name or is he a clone?

Then the auditory processing catches up and I remember that I probably misheard them and I should be thinking of words that sound like what I heard but actually make sense

Post Content: [deleted]

User Comment: You should not be ashamed to talk to the people you love! I'm sure they love you and would love to hear your issues and a way to fix them! But if you are uncomfortable, I strongly recommend talking to a teacher or a counselor at school to address your at-home or outside of home problems, doing this can better help the relationship between your loved ones so you can change the way you feel and get better! You're not alone, we are here for you!! ❤ 

  
But I strongly recommend not asking random strangers to talk to you for your problems, trust me, you don't want more fuel to the fire! 😅 But yes, do get someone to talk to!  😁

Post Title: tired
Post Content: i feel like my depression has gotten so mentally and physically crippling that it's getting so hard to keep myself on track. i just feel so, so, so tired all the time and all i want to do is sleep and rest. it takes me hours to do daily things like shower and eat and it's really affecting how i'm performing in school. i can never focus and i feel like my memory's gotten too shitty that i fear how i'll be able to get through the rest of the semester like this. this isn't my first time feeling like this but man i just hate how these depression lows hit so hard every time. i can't even bounce back from it either, just feels like i'm just headed downhill all the time 

User Comment: You need medical attention in my opinion. Your symptoms are very similar to mine and i think meds can help you a lot. Talk to ur doc
Author Reply: if its not too privy, can i ask what type of meds were given to you? were they also antidepressants? i've been feeling dizzy and faint a lot and im always told that it could also be due to my anxiety/depression but im not sure

Post Title: Today is my birthday I can’t believe I’m still alive
Post Content: As the title suggests I’m extremely surprised I got to this day. Since about a year now I’ve experienced chronic heart burn and nausea. Every. Single. Day.
It’s soul crushing. Everything hurts. I don’t wanna do anything. But I can’t kill myself because I could never do that to my parents. I hate everyone.

My friends are so toxic. They make fun of my interests, call me childish, weird, stupid. They basically bully me psychologically. Making me scared to talk around them. I’m scared to be around them because I’m sure they’ll find something about me they’re gonna hate. They show me pictures of my favorite animal, but dead and maimed. Always gets a laugh out of them when I recoil in disgust. 

Doctors fail me. A year of this torture and they can’t even diagnose my pain. They don’t send medical files, my cases get lost in their system. It’s like no one cares. I’m told to suck it up, I’m dramatic or that I have to just wait. I CANT WAIT ANYMORE! I’m in so much daily pain. I can’t even eat properly, I take so many meds I get nauseous on top of being nauseous. I wish I could puke but I can’t even do that. I can just sit there and wait. I can’t do nothing. No one knows what’s wrong and no one seems to care. I don’t trust doctors anymore. I had to switch therapists and I’m genuinely thinking about going to a ward or something. Cause I can’t live like this.

User Comment: Please for your health, ditch those friends.  They are probably contributing to the stress which may exacerbate your stomach condition. I’d rather have no friends than friends like that.  Find a group with similar interests through a hobby, church, or non- profit you feel you can get behind.  This will help you meet other people who will hopefully be actual friends.  I’m sorry you’ve had such crappy experiences in the health system, but don’t give up, keep trying different doctors until you find a good one that listens- they are hard to find but they exist.  Have you looked into food sensitivities at all?  There may be a category of foods causing the issue or maybe see a gastric specialist that has possibly seen similar symptoms in others.  Are you being treated for GERD? Praying for answers and new friends!  You deserve better!
Author Reply: Already ditched them but I feel like they still haunt me. Especially the one that showed me those fotos and another that always copied and belittled me. They just always creep back into my life like a headache. I’m genuinely scared to find friends again. After this experience I’m even more insecure about myself. \n\nI’ve been to the hospital about my stomach problems, even gastro. They can’t find anything and it’s infuriating since I’m in pain and they all pretend like I’m making it up.\n\nWhat is GERD? Thank you for your answer.

Post Title: Haven’t eaten in five days
Post Content: This is my second time ever posting on Reddit, or social media in general. The first post was on a suicide page here after my then fiancée left me without rhythm or reason two years ago. Didn’t get any responses on that post and felt kind of foolish for seeking support or advice, but here I am trying again. 

Like the title says, I haven’t eaten anything in five days. I know I should, but the thought of food and eating makes me nauseous and feels gross. I’ve had a couple bottles of water over the last five days, and even that felt like a task. 

I really hate this about myself, but I have a few mental health diagnoses. Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder to name a couple. Got a history of being abused as a kid by family physically. Also sexual abuse. I’ll mention I’m a man, and I know sometimes it’s hard to believe a male can be sexually assaulted, but it happens I promise, and it’s not always by other men. In my case it was a man and women all separate occasions though and not all during my childhood. 

Anyway, I’m hoping someone here has a little bit of advice. Umm if not that’s okay I guess. 

User Comment: First of all, I’m sorry to hear you’ve been having such a rough time. The fact that you had to basically make a disclaimer about male sexual assault speaks volumes about our society.

The not-eating has happened to me too. A few things helped me. The first was always keeping food nearby (like literally right in front of me at my desk) with a few simple options. Even if all I did was nibble occasionally it was better than nothing. The 2nd was taking a multivitamin every day, which helped a bit with the guilt. The 3rd was trying to drink some calories. Juice, milk, smoothies stuff like that. Lastly, I went for walks to try to stimulate my appetite enough to at least try to eat.
Author Reply: Yeah, men being sexually assaulted is a tough thing to accept for some.\n\nWhat kind of food do you keep nearby you?

Post Title: I can't tell if getting a pet would be good or bad for me
Post Content: So I always see the usual stuff saying that having a pet can help with depression, but I've also seen the opposite, saying that it could make things worse if you can't take care of it.

I recently managed to break out of a period where I just didn't care for anything for years, but I'm starting to think I might be starting to fall back into that state.

I do really want a pet. I'd love a dog or a cat, but I'm worried that my depression might be too much, and that I'll just harm the animal more than help it. I'm just so unsure, and I'm not sure if I should take that chance when it involves another life.

User Comment: Life with pets is having a friends who can’t talk to you back but love you unconditionally. Same time, they will come and cost you. You just have to be ready to take responsibility.
Author Reply: Right. Cost me. I feel stupid even considering the option, since I could never financially afford to care for anything. Thanks for the reminder of the obvious.

Post Title: I have depression here, drop by me and lets have a talk.
Post Content: If you're telling me not to kys. Im sorry but you're not changing my mind i have until new years eve you could ask me aeverything every bit of secrets i dont really give a fug at this point. For me its just memories and im not bringing them with me to the grave so im sharing it with you. Ask me anything.Im 17 btw.

User Comment: I’m also 17. I have also been having trouble for a very, very long time. Literally the only thing that has kept me going this past year has been curiosity. I understand that’s stupid, but when I couldn’t find the desire to keep being alive, I could at least find the desire to see what’s next. Every day felt nauseating, but something interesting definitely happened. I found a new granola bar flavor, I passed a tree that smelled really weird, my friend talked to me about their day. None of these things made me happy, necessarily, but they kept me interested. I can’t convince you to not kill yourself, I’m someone on the internet. I know it isn’t helpful to tell you to find reasons to be happy, because I’ve been there. Keep going for the chance that something new, not even something good, but something new will happen. Your life can change so slowly you don’t even notice it. Last night it snowed after a crazy heat wave, I just stood out there in the darkness and cold, listening to the silence. It’s the closest I’ve felt to being actually happy, just that one interesting moment. My life has not changed all that much, but i’m glad I stayed alive long enough to feel that snow last night, if anything. Just something to think about, no pressure. But I found it helpful. I hope you have your moment in the snow, sometime before new years. Or maybe after. Up to you. Good luck, and lots of love. I’m sorry you’re going through this shit.

Post Content: My life is not going alright. It was all good for some years, I thought Depression was a thing i overcame, boom! Out of nowhere i relapsed. Everyday is becoming a struggle. 

For most of my life ive been a semi shutin. I want to be happy. Im compiling a list of things that might make me happy. What would make you happy if you magically started something today.

 

User Comment: I don't have anything that makes me happy anymore.  I have my family and my animals that make it easier but they don't make me feel happy very often anymore either.  Happy things or feel good things are too fleeting for me to hold on, so I mostly feel frustrated and treading water.

I don’t know if it’s possible to do that much damage in one week but I googled and one site said it is. Now I’m obsessing. But I also know I have anxiety so I don’t know what’s valid. I’m not vain but I have perfectionism and any kind of damage to myself and anything I’m responsible for sends me into a spiral.

Post Title: can't cook and can't learn because my roommate is judgmental and a boss at cooking
Post Content: seeking advice.

I am terrible with food, I don't really have a good sense of taste. I will eat the fanciest dish and not care in the slightest. I'm an "eat to live" person. parents never taught me how to cook. 

only when I'm alone, because I'm so hungry after hiding from the kitchen, I try to just goof around on the stove with what we have (we share food now, her idea). sometimes I think I get lucky and make something taste good, but I mostly just avoid preparing food because I don't know what I'm doing. I get so incredibly angry and frustrated while I'm trying to learn a cooking skill or follow a recipe, and I basically only eat pinto beans I bake in advance and rice, and a vegetable when I have it. I eat the microwaveable stuff from trader Joe's and what not. I feel so guilty about the microwavable stuff or ramen that I end up not eating at all some nights.

My roommate's passion is literally food and home cooking. She can do anything in the kitchen and the majority of the books in the apartment are cookbooks or food related. Naturally, because of anxiety and shame, I only try to cook something when my roommate isn't home. *Note that the past three roommate situations have been like this though, it's not just her. It's just amplified now because she's actually amazing at it. It pains me to acknowledge any of it to my current roommate because it's embarrassing, this anxiety and idiocy. I am aware I am the problem and that I need to learn, but I can't get myself in the kitchen and I almost break down and cry of my roommate sees me in there. I wish she could imbue her knowledge to me but I hate being so shit at something people are so good at. people are hinting about it in my life.

Since July I've worked at whole foods in the prepared foods department and I'm sort of learning about food there in the kitchen, but it never manifests at home, the production mindset. I feel terrible inside at home in regards to eating and food. Sometimes I don't eat and I'm getting hungry.  

What should I do?

User Comment: Lets say 3 months then to get “not bad”.
Author Reply: Ok. In that time I'm lost on what even to do. How do I organize a plan, I don't even know what to learn? Like false beginner level, I know very very basic things

Post Title: I don't think I deserve to be listened to
Post Content: I am completely alone on this planet. I have no family left and I have no friends. I stopped giving out money, doing favors for others, and putting up with the abuse. It's been a quiet, peaceful few years. My house is surrounded by woods and I usually take peace in sitting outside and absorbing the life of nature. I feed the birds and a stray cat and her kittens she had in my garden. And I have a dog inside the house.....OK, so maybe I'm not completely alone. (I had to put my other dog down last month.) 

I've attempted group therapy but I never talk about myself. Instead, I tried to help others deal with their problems. I just don't feel like my problems matter. 

I've been trying to find a job for almost two years now. This year, my car, my water heater, my washing machine, and my dog died. Two of those I had to replace, one got cremated, and the washing machine is just sitting there being useless. My savings are down to almost nothing. And now, still grieving my dog, uncertain about the future, and dealing with the bitter loneliness of the holidays, everything has gotten difficult to handle. Mind you, I'm not suicidal. I still have one dog that loves and depends on me. Not to mention, the cats, birds, deer, raccoons....well, I'll feed anything that wanders up.

I think I just wanted to be heard for once. Thanks for reading.

User Comment: I know I'm just one person, but I believe your problems matter, and I believe you matter. You're a human being, and regardless of if you took an approach to life as a leader, someone active, an assistant, or even a friend to someone, you have an important story to tell. Not only that--you carry the stories and personalities of every person (and creature) you've met and been there for in the past, too. That matters, and that's worth something.

I'm starting in on my middle ages now. For 9 1/2 years I was in this cloud of ambiguity in denial of the meaning of everything--I was a nihilist of sorts. This last half year through my own philosophical journey though, I realized something, and it's the opposite of where I was before--everything I believe objectively matters. Whatever background or belief you come from, everyone usually acknowledges the power of time. It brings everything from one moment to the next. It's something so powerful, I just can't take that power for granted and believe what is brought forward every moment doesn't matter for something. Everything (even the space between things) that is brought forward I feel means something and matters. And that means you, and everything about you, matters too.

Animals may not know the holidays like we do, but they feel the chill in the air. I'm sure that they're happy or grateful in the way animals are that you're there for them. That counts for a lot. We have it a little harder as human beings as we get to contend with the chill, the broken appliances, and the memories of what once was. Just know that those memories we have of holidays past--they aren't gone. Every one of them will exist in the memory of what once in the universe for eternity (or at least that's what I believe). And whoever you are, you deserve to be heard. 

If you don't like talking about yourself, then there's always what others told you about their stories to tell. It's something to tell and for others to hear, at least. I'm sorry you're going through a hard time. Sometimes it can help, even for a second, to appreciate the silly, seemingly small things. A warm cup of coffee. Watching animals eat. Even seeing a breeze pass through the leaves on a tree. I'm not alone in the same way, but I honestly see it going that way for me in the future... not sure why, but it just feels that way. But I have to realize any life we get? That's something to be grateful for sometimes... especially if we can write down three or four things in the tough times and that brings a little warmth and compassion back to ourselves, that's really something.

Person to person, I'm sorry you're sad. I think we all know as human beings that these things come and go... it's not always necessary to push off the sadness. Sometimes you just have to be with it, and have a little empathy for yourself. You're going to be happy again, and the hope of some good times coming back is enough to want to carry on regardless of hardships. It's worth it to try revisiting ideas we've tried in the past, even if they haven't worked before, like getting out and trying to meet others (if that's what you would want). People care what you have to say, because on a base level, it seems people care what other people say generally--we all love to hear a good story every now and again! I really hope you have a good holiday and realize how much those animals appreciate what you're doing, even if they can't say it. Take care.
Author Reply: I really do take pleasure in just sitting outside and listening to nature, feeling the breeze, etc. And it's funny that you mentioned other people's stories because I had been writing a book and I used stories from my family to flesh out the characters. Unfortunately I'd not backed up my work when that laptop crashed. But, maybe I'm just meant to start over. I still have the rough draft of the first ten chapters. \n\nI've often told others that their depression just means they're in a valley and they'll be climbing another hill before too long.

Post Content: I am officially in fear of my life now and for my family's life as well. I also scared for others as well.

I don't even know what to do now and I have to be completely honest, I have never been more nervous in my life.

2. Bird flu is on the rise and I am afraid to do anymore Pandemic tactics again, I am afraid there will a whole pandemic going around and I am afraid to go back outside.

3 .Apparently, the US dept of agriculture can't announce what is safe to eat anymore due to the trump administration causing a Communcations Blackout meaning it could be the start of more things being affected due to trump

Post Title: Anyone know about how to recover or maintain the body? Kinda weird but I'm worried.
Post Content: [deleted]

User Comment: Just start eating more and then doing some light exercises. If you have a VR headset it could probably help make moving around a little more enjoyable too.

I'd probably focus on the eating part a little more though if I were you. Sounds like you might collapse if you try to do any heavy the exercises in this state.

Just eat more and then probably start doing some exercises a week later. Gradually increase your food amount. We don't want to risk you getting constipated or having gastrointestinal issues.

Yogurt is something very easy to digest and it's actually quite healthy for you. I prefer Greek yogurt but you could totally just go for Yoplait or something with a little bit more flavor and sugar. The important part about yogurt is the probiotics inside of them. They help with your gut health. Add some granola, berries and perhaps a little bit of honey in their and you're golden. The granola offers texture, carbs and a little bit of fiber. Berries offer fiber and natural sugar to help regulate energy throughout the day. Honey is just to make it a little sweeter if you want it too. It's nature's sweetener.

And then maybe after that you can have some nuts. You might think this doesn't matter, but it can help. I didn't think it mattered too. But I kind of noticed the difference when I ate them and when I didn't eat them. They have fats that satiate your hunger. It also helps with hormones overall.

Maybe get a sandwich for lunch. Eat some hard boiled eggs or string cheese in between lunch and dinner. And then have some protein with veggies and a little bit of carbs for dinner.

Get a lot of sleep. It's good to do all of the above
 But if you don't get quality sleep then it hinders your growth. Sleep is so important. Stress might not be easily manageable, especially if it's external stress. But try to remember why you're trying to change when things get tough. It can help you if you're in a pinch and are starting to lose your way

Floss and brush your teeth daily. There is no cure for this. You just gotta start. Once a week is okay. Once a couple of days is okay. Just start.

And most importantly, just give yourself a break. it's cool to be a little easy on yourself. Give yourself compassion

User Comment: This is something I frequently think about and as the comments say I really agree that as much as the sun does do an affect on skin it’s important to note that the beauty you may desire in your skin or as a part of self care ritual you may find other ways like taking time to relax and take things one step at a time. Aging is a natural thing for eveything if everything stayed young forever vanity would take over everything appreciate yourself as you do I hope you have wonderful days and find calmness no shames in stressing either just how the chems in our brain works but overcoming it brings that sense of accomplishment like no other🙏
